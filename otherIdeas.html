          <h2>Ideas</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Create two areas to submit. The program then takes in both strings, creates a markov chain for both, and then alternates using a word in one chain, randomly picking its "child" value, then searching the other markov chain with that value. This would place each word with a ping pong effect, picming from each chain based on the previous word in the other chain.</li>
                <ol> <strong>issues to deal with:</strong>
                    <li>What if one of the markov chains does not have the desired word? Would you just skip that bounce to the other chain and move on?</li>
                </ol>
              <li>Use an test field to have the user type a single word, this word would then be used to create an acrostic poem. The letters of that word would search the markov chain object, using the key that matched, and then filling in the line as seen in the "normal" poem generator. This would repeat for each letter of the supplied word.</li>
          </ol>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>This generator takes in a text/corpus</li>
                <li>creates an markov chain object from the words in that text</li>
                <li>The probablity comes in due to the fact that i fill repeat words into the key value array. i.e. {word: ["the", "the", "this", "that"]} because i repeat "the", it will be picked 50% of the time</li>
            </ol>
            <ol><strong>Issues</strong>
                <li>This poem generator will just simple do nothing if the text is not varied enough for the amount of lines the user wants. The only guard i placed is capping the max amount of lines to 10. So as of now i have zero error checking.</li>
                <li>The puncuation is odd. The way I created (.split(' ')) an array and .join(" ")-ed it back, means i have that " " before the punctuation. This can be fixed, i just ran out of time. My only punctuation I have adressed: I have place a "," after each line, except the last line, which gets a "."</li>
                <li>I do nothing with capitolizing the first word. This could be done with a helper function that capitolized the word before i puch it to my sentence array. If i plan to have everyother line have a ".", this helper function can be used multiple times</li>
